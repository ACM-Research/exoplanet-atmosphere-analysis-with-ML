# Determining the Composition of Exoplanet Atmospheres with Machine Learning

## Description
Determining an exoplanet's atmosphere's temperature and composition is a difficult and time consuming task. Research has demonstrated that machine learning models are able to perform atmospheric retrieval more efficiently than traditional models, however this research is still in its beginning stages. Participants will research different machine learning models to find the most efficient model for atmospheric retrieval.
